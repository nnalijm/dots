## [enable_touch]

## [monitor]

*Monitor* script allows manipulation with connected monitors. Script uses dmenu as a menu for selectiong monitors and positions for their displaying.

To simplify the use of the script the following line might be used in configuration file of window manager(i3 in my case).

```bash
bindsym --release Mod1+c exec monitor
```

## [tordd]

## [tordone]
